# React / Redux Tic Tac Toe

## Setup & Usage

BEFORE RUNNING: One thing to note is that the kyt boilerplate uses a version of Node Sass that requires Node 8.0, so make sure your NVM is set to use Node 8.0 before running the application (this is an issue I ran into since my machine was on Node 10). You can do this by running `nvm use 8.0`.

--------

To run this app:
* `npm install`
* `npm run build`
* `npm run start`

This is built on the NYT kyt boilerplate for local hosting and webpack configuration. The implementation is a purely React & Redux version of the matching game, using Redux to handle state and Redux async actions to fetch data.
